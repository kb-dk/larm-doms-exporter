# Script for daily export of Kuana records from Summa for use by Larm.

## daily_extract.sh
To get the script to work it should only be necessary to configure a Solr endpoint and output directory in summarise.conf and a seed timestamp in timestamp.txt. After which,
simply run daily_extract.sh once per day.
